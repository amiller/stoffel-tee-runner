//! Lobby record types — the wire schema shared by the verifier, the lobby
//! service, and the webapp.
//!
//! **This schema is frozen.** Several components are built against it
//! independently; changing a field name or a signing preimage here breaks the
//! others silently. If something genuinely needs to change, say so and change
//! it here once, rather than locally in a consumer.
//!
//! This crate deliberately does not depend on `stoffel-vm`. Attestation
//! evidence travels as opaque strings, so the lobby service and the webapp can
//! handle records without pulling in the MPC VM and its DCAP dependency tree.
//! Only the verifier needs those, and it depends on `stoffel-vm` directly.
//!
//! ## The trust story these types encode
//!
//! The lobby is an untrusted index. A reader never takes the service's word for
//! anything: every record carries a signature by the key that made it, and the
//! attestation evidence travels inline, so the reader re-verifies. What the
//! service can still do is *omit* — censorship and equivocation are the residual
//! trust, and are out of scope for v1.
//!
//! The chain that makes a signature mean something:
//!
//! 1. A node holds a long-term Ed25519 key that survives restarts (L1).
//! 2. Its TDX quote binds `hash(long_term_pubkey)` in `report_data[8..40]`, so
//!    the hardware attests to *that key*, not to a per-process one.
//! 3. Every [`JoinRecord`] and [`ResultRecord`] it signs is therefore
//!    attributable to an attested node running a known measurement.
//!
//! Break any link and the record is worthless — which is why the verifier checks
//! all of them rather than just the signature.
//!
//! ## Signing
//!
//! Every signed type implements [`Signed`]. The preimage is the canonical JSON
//! of the record with `signature` set to the empty string, domain-separated by a
//! per-type prefix. Domain separation is not decorative: without it, a
//! `JoinRecord` for job X could be replayed as some other record type that
//! happens to serialize the same way.
